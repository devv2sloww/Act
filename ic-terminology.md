# IC Terminology

When you are on the Server, you are expected to keep in-character unless you're involved in a Staff Situation **(Staff Sit)** or whenever a Staff Member is speaking to you while they are on their doing **Staff Duties**. You are expected NEVER to break character or try not to, to the best of your ability at all times throughout the time you are in-game

**Punishment For Breaking Rules Can Be: Kicked/Jail Time/Ban**
