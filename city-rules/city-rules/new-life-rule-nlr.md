# New Life Rule (NLR)

**1)** Players that are **Killed** **CANNOT** be wiped of all memory pertaining to a Group or long-term RP and **MAY ONLY** NLR specific things revolving a Scenario or on-going RP. **2)** Players **CANNOT** loop-hole the 1-Hour Timer. It's recommended that if you got killed during a **Gang v Gang** Situation, your whole Gang sits out so that you avoid being accused of breaking NLR. This could also go to RP for further medical treatment, as an idea. **3)** You **CANNOT** start **ANY** Violent-RP during the **1-Hour** of **NLR!** However, if someone else starts it then you **CAN** defend yourself. Make sure you **DON'T** loop-hole this! It's recommended to remove yourself from the situation completely if downed! **4)** This also goes towards revenge-killing, you **CANNOT** instantly go after the person that killed you previous once you've received medical treatment or have been released from hospital (bedrest). Make sure that you are being realistic with this.
