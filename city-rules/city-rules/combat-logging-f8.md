# Combat Logging (F8)

**1) Subject A** is speeding and is getting pulled over by a Law Enforcement Officer, he knows that he will be arrested as soon as they run his plates as he's got active warrants so then **Subject A** decides to F8 Quit to avoid being arrested! **2) Subject A** is being held at gun-point by **Subject B & Gang** so **Subject A** doesn't want to lose his items from being robbed, so he F8 Quits to avoid being robbed! **3) Subject A** has been arrested and is in cuffs, he then Combat Logs and comes back to get out of cuffs so that he could escape custody, this would be Combat Logging too
