# VDM (Vehicle Death Match)

**Subject A** is a Police Officer and they respond to a call of shots fired around Legion Square, they pull into the side-path besides the bank and are ambushed. **Subject B & Gang** aim guns at him from the front, and **Subject A's** reflex is to instantly drive back but doesn't notice more of **Subject B's Gang Members** are behind him trying to block him in! **Subject A's** interaction was TOO QUICK for him **NOT** to value his life, there was distance and the proximity wasn't that much, which means it would be reasonable to also believe he could get away. However, he runs over and downs **Subject B's Gang Members** in the process of trying to evade! **THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED VDM!** - The Situation was Reasonable, and the actions would be lawful alongside the fact he wasn't aware they would be there in that exact place, at that exact time.
