# Random Death Match

Random Death Match **(RDM)** is killing someone without any Valid or Realistic reason. Killing someone while they are AFK and canâ€™t react or defend themselves is also RDM and Force-RP. Also, killing someone without initiation is considered RDM.

Killing a Player for **no reason** randomly with **no intention to roleplaying the incident**. Prior interaction with a player and a **valid exchange** **MUST** be established before you can kill someone

#### **Example of RDM (Random Death Match)** <a href="#example-of-rdm-random-death-match" id="example-of-rdm-random-death-match"></a>

**Subject A** sees and walks over towards **Subject B** (who he has never seen or spoken to) and shoots them, downing them and leaving them to be. **THIS IS CONSIDERED RDM**

#### **Example of a Valid Interaction & Initiation** <a href="#example-of-a-valid-interaction-and-initiation" id="example-of-a-valid-interaction-and-initiation"></a>

**Subject A** has had a prior interaction with **Subject B** where **Subject B** is in a rival gang and both Subjects have had **X Y Z** altercation and threats being thrown around repeatedly and publicly around other people. **\*Time Passes\* Subject A** is with his Group (#) and they see **Subject B** who had shot their friend and fled the scene instantly. **Subject A & His Group** initiate over phone or face to face: _"You shot my friend! You will pay!"_ then **Subject A** decides to fire upon **Subject B** taking him out.
