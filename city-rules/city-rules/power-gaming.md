# Power-Gaming

Power Gaming can be seen as many different things, it can be **abusing** GTA V Mechanics that wouldn't be realistic to get a gain in RP, which could also be classed as **Fail RP** or even **Minor Exploiting** depending on the circumstances. **POWER GAMING** is performing an Unrealistic Action against someone without providing them an opportunity to evade such an action, or **forcing** it upon them.
