# Fail Roleplay (RP)

This is anything the can be considered an **Unrealistic Situation**. This is usually Common Sense, simply ask yourself these questions: Does this happen IRL? or Would you do this IRL? or Does this match your character's storyline?

No Fail RP (Includes messing around and horse-playing) because this is **PROHIBITED!**

If you are injured or hurt you have to RP your injuries realistically. For example: if you are in a police chase and your car crashes you can not just jump out of the car and run. Not role-playing injuries is Fail-RP and can result in a **FINE or BAN** being issued!

#### **BASIC & STANDARD SCENARIOS** <a href="#basic-and-standard-scenarios" id="basic-and-standard-scenarios"></a>

Not role-playing injuries - Use Common Sense (Consider Injury and Recovery Time for Better RP)

Unrealistic Driving - Ramping off Buildings or Hills, off-roading in non off-road vehicles

Horse-playing - Shooting or Randomly Punching your Friends or Group Members (Messing around)

Using "Ragdoll" Exploits to Loop-hole being shot - Ban issued for **Minor Exploiting** depending on Severity Major Head-glitching on an **Exploit** like level!

Failure to respond to **/me** or **/do**'s to avoid RP Scenarios

Using walkie talkie while handcuffed or tied!

Using emotes or glitches to go through walls or buildings - Ban issued for **Minor Exploiting** depending on Severity Carrying someone out of a Vehicle by pressing **"X"** with **NO** RP! - **Exploit Offence** Category Players **SHOULD NOT** be "Speed Boosting" / Strafing in an Unrealistic Way! - **Exploit Offence** Category. Unrealistic for you to be Teleporting all over the place in PvP!

These are **NOT ALL** the Fail-RP Examples & Rules. As stated before, and in the **Disclaimer** too, you **MUST** use Common Sense at all times. If you feel like you won't be able to do set action in real-life, then **DO NOT** do it while role-playing on the server as it won't be realistic!
