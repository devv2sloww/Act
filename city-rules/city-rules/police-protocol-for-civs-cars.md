# Police Protocol For Civs (cars)

#### **Citizens' Info On Police Procedures** <a href="#citizens-info-on-police-procedures" id="citizens-info-on-police-procedures"></a>

**If pd catches your plate and makes mdt report and submits you to the state, they will approve a 1-week hold on your vehicle driving recklessly in NewSauceCity Drive in the right areas, at the right speeds.**

**Realistic vibes within the community. Supporter Add On's will be held up 1-2 weeks if needed if the same car is constantly used to power the game with speeds against PD. Car Development is always updating in Actavis RP and car speeds may vary, and be tuned at any moment** **Police Officers**

**Using fake plates: If you use fake plates and pd eventually figures out your car and who owns it, Your car will be impounded for 7-14 IRL days.** _(This goes for ALL Local and Import Cars.) (1-1Cars/Super-Cars will get a 10-day hold, no early impound release)_

**You must have a 45-second clip, with a plate radar lock, and mdt report showing in the clip the owner of the car, doing over 120mph within the city limits. If you impound someone's car without submitting the clip correctly**

**You will be banned for 24 hours, for failure to follow PD Protocol and possibly demotion in rank**
